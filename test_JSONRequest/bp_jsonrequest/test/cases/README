README:

To add test cases for JSONRequest.

Inside of the tests folder:

1. make a copy of case1.rb and rename to whatever you want, make sure its still .rb though (in this readme ill use example.rb as an example).

2. make a json file, i.e. example.json, and in it you can specify what you want as the parameters to @s.get() and @s.post()

3. make a folder of the same name.
	-doGET.json should contain a map of what you want to returned from 	@s.get()
	-doPOST.json should contain a map of what you want to returned from 	@s.post()

4. add your test case as a new testcase in test_JsonRequest.rb as a new definition. #look at code and previous examples

5. ruby test_JsonRequest.rb
